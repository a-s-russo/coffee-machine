# Coffee vending machine

A script to simulate interaction with a coffee vending machine via the command line interface as a customer or as an owner (via secret commands).

Inspired by the project for day 15 of the course: [100 Days of Python](https://100daysofpython.dev/).

## Running

To run the simulation:
1. Ensure [Python](https://www.python.org/) is installed on your computer.
2. Ensure the Python package [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/) is installed using `pip install tabulate`.
3. Download the relevant files from this repository:
    - For the functional programming approach, downloand `coffee.py` from the `üìÅfunctional-programming-approach` folder.
    - For the object-oriented approach, download the Python scripts from the `üìÅobject-oriented-approach` folder (that is, the five `*.py` files) into the same folder.
4. Run `coffee.py` or `main.py`, respectively.

(The functionality between the functional programming and object-oriented approaches should be mostly the same.)

## Modifying

Change the relevant values in the relevant scripts as desired, such as the menu items and the machine's starting stock levels.
